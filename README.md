**Overview******

This project automates the creation of a 50-slide PowerPoint presentation by extracting content from a given document. Specifically, it reads markdown cells from a Jupyter Notebook (e.g., web application firewall.ipynb) that describes various aspects of Web Application Firewalls (WAF). The script generates slides based on the document's content, ensuring that the presentation covers all key topics from introduction to conclusion.

**Features******

Automated Slide Creation: Extracts markdown content to dynamically generate slide titles and detailed content.
Comprehensive Coverage: Produces a full 50-slide presentation, adding supplementary slides if the source document lacks enough content.
Easy Customization: Modify the Python script to tailor slide formatting, content extraction, and additional details as needed.

**Output:
******
The generated presentation, named Web_Application_Firewall_Presentation_From_Notebook.pptx, will be saved in the project directory.

You can easily modify the script to:

Change slide layouts or formatting.
Adjust how content is extracted or parsed.
Integrate additional data sources or further enhance the presentation content.

**Conclusion******
This tool streamlines the process of transforming documentation into a structured, professional presentation. It is ideal for quickly preparing technical slides on topics such as Web Application Firewalls, saving time while ensuring comprehensive coverage of key content.
